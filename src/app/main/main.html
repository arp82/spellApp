        <h1>Spells App</h1>
        <p>
            Just a placeholder, wizardry-spells-themed app of sorts to play around with some AngularJS features. Currently, the application provides a simple REST interface (against a local JSON-server) to add and remove spells into your Spellbook (you can navigate to it using the Navigation Bar). Every element is a component (well, except for the home site, that's still a template/controller pair). Future "features":
            <ul>
            <li>Add/Remove spells from the "library" (main database). Just to try stuff with forms.</li>
            <li>Cast spells (just for the lols, or maybe to try some graphics library?).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
