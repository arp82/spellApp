# spellApp
Just a placeholder, wizardry-spells-themed app of sorts to play around with some AngularJS features. Currently, the application provides a simple REST interface (against a local JSON-server) to add and remove spells into your Spellbook (you can navigate to it using the Navigation Bar). Every element is a component (well, except for the home site state, that's still a template/controller pair). Future "features":
- Add/Remove spells from the "library" (main database). Just to try stuff with forms.
- Cast spells (just for the lols, or maybe to try some graphics library?).
